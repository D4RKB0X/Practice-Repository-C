# My C++ Projects

Welcome to my collection of C++ projects! This repository demonstrates my journey learning and applying C++ concepts, from basic arrays and pointers to advanced object-oriented programming (OOP) and data structures. The projects are grouped into categories for clarity.

---

## 📂 Arrays Collection
Projects that focus on working with arrays, including searching, averaging, and analyzing data.

- **Array_AverageCalculator.cpp** – Calculate the average of array elements.
- **Array_FindElement.cpp** – Search for a specific element in an array.
- **Array_PriceAnalysis.cpp** – Analyze a set of prices (min, max, average).
